## Why I Built This

Since the AI revolution began, my workflow changed completely - but not entirely for the better.

I found myself constantly writing content in various apps (Slack, Gmail, Notes, VS Code) and then interrupting my flow to:
1. Copy the text.
2. Switch to a browser tab with ChatGPT or Claude.
3. Paste the text and write a prompt ("Make this more professional," "Fix the grammar," "Translate to English").
4. Wait for the result.
5. Copy the result.
6. Switch back to my original app.
7. Paste it back.

It was exhausting. The constant context switching was killing my focus. I wanted the AI to come to *me*, right where I was working, without the friction.

**That's why I built Echoo.**

## Features

Fix typos, grammar, rewrite in any tone, dictate with voice, and run custom AI prompts via shortcuts. No switching windows. Just flow.
