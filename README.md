## Why I Built This

Since the AI revolution began, my workflow changed completely—but not entirely for the better.

I found myself constantly writing content in various apps (Slack, Gmail, Notes, VS Code) and then interrupting my flow to:
1. Copy the text.
2. Switch to a browser tab with ChatGPT or Claude.
3. Paste the text and write a prompt ("Make this more professional," "Fix the grammar," "Translate to English").
4. Wait for the result.
5. Copy the result.
6. Switch back to my original app.
7. Paste it back.

It was exhausting. The constant context switching was killing my focus. I wanted the AI to come to *me*, right where I was working, without the friction.

**That's why I built Echoo.**

Echoo brings AI text transformation directly to your fingertips. Select text anywhere on your Mac, hit a shortcut, and watch it transform instantly. No tab switching. No copy-pasting. Just flow.

## Features

Echoo is designed to be invisible until you need it, and instant when you do.

### 🎙️ Voice Superpowers
Dictate and translate simultaneously. Speak naturally, and let Echoo handle the rest.
- **Dictate & Translate** (`⌥ + V`): Speak in one language, paste in another.
- **Voice Instructions** (`⌥ + I`): Select text and tell Echoo what to do with it ("Make this shorter," "Change tone to friendly").

### ⚡ Instant Actions
Common tasks are just a keystroke away. *All shortcuts are fully customizable to fit your workflow.*
- **Rewrite** (`⌥ + R`): Instantly improve grammar, clarity, and flow.
- **Summarize** (`⌥ + S`): Get the gist of long emails or documents.
- **Translate** (`⌥ + T`): Translate selected text to your preferred language.
- **Prompt Craft** (`⌥ + P`): Optimize your raw prompts for better AI results.

### 📄 File Intelligence
- **Process Files**: Select a PDF, DOC, or TXT file in Finder and run summaries or translations on it without even opening the file.

### 🛠️ Custom Workflows
- **Your Prompts, Your Shortcuts**: Create your own custom AI commands. Need to convert JSON? Generate a code review? Reply to emails? Create a custom prompt and assign it a global hotkey (e.g., `⌘ + ⇧ + J`).

## Privacy First

Your data belongs to you.
- **Local Data**: All your settings and history stay on your machine.
- **No Training**: We do not use your text to train our models.
- **Secure Keys**: Your API keys are stored securely in the macOS Keychain.

## Download

Echoo is 100% free to use.
